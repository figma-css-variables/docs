This document outlines the network resources the Figma plugin connects to when using the Community build.

## Sentry

We use **Sentry** to track errors and crashes, which helps us identify and resolve issues efficiently.

The plugin sends error reports to **sentry.io**. These reports do not contain any personally identifiable information (PII).
